Datasets

We use two datasets (IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR) in our paper.

For IU X-Ray, you can download the dataset from [here](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/) and then put the files in iu_xray.

For MIMIC-CXR, you can download the dataset from [here](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.1.0/) and then put the files in mimic.

Run the code:

'python train.py'
